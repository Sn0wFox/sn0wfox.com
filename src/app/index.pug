              strong  Ruben PÃ©ricas-Moya
              | , and I'm a french
              strong  developer
              |  and student in Computer Science. I'm currently in my 4th year at INSA Lyon,
              | completing my master degree in Computer Science engineering.
            p.text-light.text-justify On the internet my name is
              strong  Sn0wFox
              |  - and that's the name I use for most of my personal projects.
              | The snow has always made me calm and serene,
              | and I like to think that I'm as curious as a Fox; hence my pseudo.
            br
            p.text-light.text-justify Beside coding I love practicing sports, especially those where you have
              |  to run after something. Joke aside, I actually won
              strong  the 2016 French Universities National Ultimate Championships
              | . Don't know about Ultimate ?&nbsp;

              |  I'm also a bit musician, since I play guitar.
          .col-sm-12.text-center
            p.text-light.complementary-text I like to try everything I hear about,
              |  and that's most likely because i'm passionate. That's how sometimes I end up testing some new
              | cool frameworks before anyone else, i.e. when they are still in alpha release (someone said Angular2 ?).
            p.text-light I'm a huge robotic enthusiast,
              |  even though my last work is mostly based on web technologies, which I find amazing.
              | I like to think that every day brings me closer to a full stack developer profile.
              | You'll find more about my work and my skills in my portfolio and in my resume.
